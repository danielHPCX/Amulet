# Amulet
Active Pendant. Just a piece of accessory that do something someone can enjoy.

Definition
==========

Active accessory is a wearable that can do more than "simply exist". Its can flash lights, make sounds, move components... if this action interact with people's curiosity, it will do.

The core purpose of this gadget is to play with others curiosity (for me acts like an ice breaker, since i am a very shy person ._.).


Hardware
========

The core of the project depends on what task it will do.

## Type B
First beta project, with a simple task: blink a LED in a fixed period. No complex actions, no complex hardware, just a simple start as everything should begin.

The main IC, TPL5111 takes care of the job. With a sleep current less than 40nA, it ensure that baterry will last for years.

All LEDs with forward voltage less than 2.9V can be used, since that all 3 LEDs be the same colour.

A CR2032 is the main power supply. Easy to find and with a limited capacity around 230mAh, makes this project a wolderfull chalenge to make it last for 5 years.
